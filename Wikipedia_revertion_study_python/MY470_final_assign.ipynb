    "The final assignment asks you to use the computational thinking and programming skills you learned in the course to answer an empirical social science question. You are expected to apply the best practices and theoretical concepts we covered in the course to produce a program that not only produces the correct output but is also legible, modular, and reasonably optimized. The assignment assumes mastery of loops, conditionals, and functions, as well as basic awareness of issues related to runtime performance.\n",

    "In the assignment, we will study reverts on Wikipedia. A revert occurs when an editor undoes the changes made by another editor. We will first identify who reverted whom and when, then identify situations in which if $A$ reverted $B$, $B$ reverted $A$ within 24 hours, and finally compare the status difference between $A$ and $B$ to the expected status difference.\n",

    "Although this assignment is quite streamlined, imagine that the tasks here are part of a larger project. How would you structure your program if in the future you may need to manipulate the data differently, add additional analyses, or modify the focus of the current analysis? For example, consider placing helping functions in a separate file called `utils.py` or `tools.py`. These would be functions that you may need in different contexts and for different tasks. "

    "\n",
    "Your goal is to create an edge list, where an edge goes from the editor who restored an earlier version of the article (the \"reverter\") to the editor who made the revision immediately after that version (the \"reverted\"). For every edge, you should know when it occured and what the \"status\" of the the reverter and the reverted were at this point in time.\n",

    "The measure of \"status\" we will use is related to seniority and activity. We will estimate status $s_i$ of editor $i$ as the base-ten logarithm of the number of edits $i$ has completed by the time of the revert under question. Transforming the number of edits with the logarithm makes sense because they follow a power-law distribution (the majority of individuals have very few edits, while a handful of individuals are responsible for most of the work). This operationalization allows to express the difference in status between two editors as the base-ten logarithm of the ratio of number of edits since $s_i - s_j = \\log_{10} e_i - \\log_{10} e_j = \\log_{10} \\frac{e_i}{e_j}$, where $e_i$ is the number of edits of editor $i$ and $e_j$ is the number of edits of editor $j$. In essence, we assume that an editor who has 10 edits compares to one with 100 edits the same way that an editor with 1,000 edits compares to one with 10,000. \n",

You should consider how you are going to use the data to decide on a reasonable data structure.\n",

    "Temporal motifs are classes of event sequences that are similar not only in the topology but also in the temporal order of the events. Our aim is to identify the two-event temporal motifs in which after $A$ reverts $B$, $B$ reverts $A$ back ($AB–BA$). To identify the motifs, use the data you pickled in the previous task. Then look at every revert and identify if and when a response occurs, restricted to a time window of 24 hours. Ignore the article titles — we are agnostic as to whether the response happens in the same or in different articles. Further, it does not matter whether the response occurs immediately after the original revert or alternatively, the reverter and the reverted are involved in other reverts in-between the original revert and the response. If more than one response occurs within 24 hours, consider only the first one as part of the motif.\n",

    "Social comparison theory states that people strive to gain accurate self-evaluations and as a result, they tend to compare themselves to those who are similar. But since focus on relative performance heightens feelings of competitiveness, rivalry is stronger among similar individuals. This leads us to expect that the editors involved in the $AB–BA$ motif tend to be closer in status than expected.\n",

    "To do this, use the data you pickled in the previous two tasks and the `matplotlib` library to plot a histogram of $s_A - s_B$ for reverts that are part of $AB–BA$ motifs on top of a histogram of $s_i - s_j$ for all other reverts. Then estimate the mean $s_A - s_B$ and the mean $s_i - s_j$ and print them. In a comment, use a couple of sentences to summarize what you observe.\n",
